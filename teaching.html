<h3 id="work">Overview</h3>

<p>
Advances in computing and electronic communication technologies have enabled ubiquitous collection of high volume, velocity, and/or variety information assets, leading to the era of big data. Big data has driven innovation, productivity, efficiency, and growth in many domains, creating enormous benefits for the global economy. However, with massive data and advanced data analytical techniques, far more information can be inferred than most people have anticipated at the time of data collection/publication, as evidenced by recent privacy leakage incidents such as the AOL search log scandal and the de-anonymization of Netflix prize data. Traditional privacy-preserving techniques are either insufficient against such new privacy attacks (e.g., anonymization and privacy notices) or preventing reasonable data usage (e.g., data encryption and data deletion). The need for a secure and privacy- preserving solution to allowing people to learn information as it was intended and stopping people from learning information in ways it was not has motivated my research.
</p>

<p>
My research attempts to provide a systematic view and an in-depth understanding of the security and privacy issues in big data applications, and design practical, secure, and privacy-preserving protocols for performing tasks widely used in big data analytics. Specifically, my research is primarily focused on <b>formalizing and addressing security and privacy problems in mobile and cloud-assisted health systems</b>, which utilizes mobile and cloud computing technologies to improve healthcare with increased access, increased quality and reduced expenses. We address the critical research challenges on security and privacy in mobile and cloud-assisted health systems from the following aspects: 
<ul>
        <li><b>Privacy-preserving learning on biomedical sensing data</b>, which enables mobile users to collaboratively train a computational model for mobile health (mHealth) monitoring</li>
		<li><b>Privacy and quality control for health data collection</b>, which leverages the computing resources of mobile devices for biomedical sensing data collection, and ensures both the quality of collected data and the privacy of participants</li>
        <li><b>Effective resource utilization for cloud computing</b>, which effectively utilizes the renewable energy in data centers to handle the randomness in health-related tasks</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
I also study the security and privacy issues in cyber-physical energy systems. A major challenge in these problems is to design mechanisms that can handle the volume, velocity, and variety of the involved data. To address this challenge, my research approach is first to identify the data analysis goals in these applications, then to rigorously model and analyze the security, privacy issues, and finally, to devise solutions that achieve the data analysis goals with rigorous and provable security and privacy guarantees. Throughout my projects, I integrate computational, information-theoretic, and cryptographic techniques to construct simple, efficient, and practical solutions.
